**walkers-editor** is an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) editor written in ðŸ¦€ **Rust** with a focus on performance. It is heavily inspired by the _Overlays_-feature of [StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete) and aims to bring its user-friendliness to the desktop and web.
